# ArrestStats

This is the Repo containing files for the Arrest Statistics In NYC Demo. 
Authors: Fourcan Abdullah, Dawa Sonam, Mike Esquivel

The source file is NYPD_Arrest_data_Year_to_Date.csv
Run the cleaner.py program in the same folder as the source file to create a AllDetails2.csv
I linked a AllDetails2.csv file in this repo as well, if you want to run the program make sure to delete the existing AllDetails2.csv file here.
You can use the existing AllDetails2.csv file here if you dont want to run the python code.

The twb file has all the dashboards, visualizations, and storyboard. It uses both NYPD_Arrest_data_Year_to_Date.csv data and AllDetails2.csv data.
AllDetails2.csv is used for the Dashboard and graphs made by Fourcan Abdullah
NYPD_Arrest_data_Year_to_Date.csv is used by Mike Esquivel and Dawa Sonam
